Vardha is a cyclonic storm which formed in southeast part
 of Bay of Bengal after developing from a deep depression.
 It is the fourth major cyclonic storm after Roanu, Kyant and
 Nada that has its origin in Bay of Bengal. The name Vardha
which means rose in Urdu and Arabic has been suggested
by the Pakistan Met department in the nomenclature list for
 cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea.
 The list was prepared by a group of eight countries
 that came up with nearly 64 names.
 The cyclone resulted in heavy precipitation over several areas
 of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Indian Meteorological
 Department (IMD) forecast said that the storm is likely
 to intensify into a severe cyclone. According to a report
 in Times of India people were worried over the possible
 storm ever since the low pressure was formed over the Arabian Sea.
